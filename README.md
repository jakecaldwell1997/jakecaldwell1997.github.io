### Projects

- Dissertation, "The Political Implications of Precarious Work"
  * This dissertation explores the impacts of precarious work arrangements on American workers' political behaviors and attitudes.
  * Employs advanced quantitative methodology such as multilevel regression models, structural equation models, and survey design to explore complex relationships between workplace exeperiences and political behaviors and attitudes.
  * Develops unique linking strategy of Current Population Survey Supplement responses to create novel dataset which contains detailed information on both individual-level contract type and voting behavior in order to derive insights into the effects of precarious work on voting.
  * Exlpores the policy space in which precarious workers do (or do not) receive workplace protections.
 
- Union Membership, Mobilization, & Turnout
  * Tracks the influence of union membership on three types of party mobilization (Democratic, Republican, combined) in presidential elections ranging from 1972 - 2020.
  * Iteratively conducts Bayesian Binomial Mixed GLMs with randomly-varying intercepts for state, and plots the 95% High-Density Intervals for each of these year-mobilization-type combinations over time.
  * Finds there appears to be no statistically detectable difference between union memberships' influence on being mobilized by either the Democratic or Republican parties.
